# Webshop

--- 

this is a basic Webshop I created using SpringBoot, Jpa and Thymeleaf as a school assignment.
## About
When the application is started the user is greeted with a page displaying a login function as well a link to a separate 
page where the user can sign up. Once signed in its possible to search for different products, add them and remove them 
from the cart. The user can then confirm the purchase prompting the application to send a confirmation email.

As an admin its possible to add products, see every order as well as confirm its status.

The application also includes a few tests.
